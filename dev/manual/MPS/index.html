A directed graph is a lattice structure with discrete lattice sites on some spatial points and each site has some directed lines attached to it. Each directed line has an arrow on it. Some of the lines connect two different sites, while each of the other lines attaches to only one site and has an open end.</p><p>Tensor network is a network structure of tensor maps on a directed graph. We associate a vector space (or in general, an object of a tensor category) to each directed line and a tensor map to each lattice site. The arrow on each line is used to distinguish the   vector space and its dual, i.e., the dual of a vector space <span>$V$</span> is represented by a leg of vector space <span>$V$</span> with an arrow pointing in the opposite direction. A tensor map is a linear map from its domain to codomain. We numerate all the lines attached to a site as <span>$1, ..., N_1+N_2$</span>, and treat the tensor product of the spaces on lines <span>$1,...,N_1$</span> as the codomain and that on lines <span>$N_1+1,...,N_1+N_2$</span> as the domain. A tensor is a tensor map with a trivial domain (<span>$N_2=0$</span>), or equivalently, a line corresponding to the unit simple object of the tensor category which can be removed or added at will. If a line connects two sites, it represents a contraction between two tensor maps. We also call the lines as legs or bonds.</p><p>Matrix product state is a tensor network that all the lattice sites are ordered in a one-dimensional chain and each tensor only connects to its left and right nearest neighbour.</p><p>The basic structure of an MPS is</p><p><img src="../figures/mps_convention.svg" alt="mps_convention"/></p><p>We use the conventions that are consistent with that in TensorLabXD.jl.</p><p>The most general form of an MPS is</p><p><img src="../figures/mps_ABconvention.svg" alt="mps_ABconvention"/></p><p>Since MPSs are usually used to represent the wave functions of quantum many-body systems on a lattice and each lattice site hosts a Hilbert space, the tensor <span>$A^{[i]}$</span> on that site has an open leg which hosts the physical Hilbert space. We call the tensor map <span>$A^{[i]}$</span> as a site tensor and its open leg as the physical leg. <span>$A^{[i]}$</span> also has two legs that    connect to its left and right neighbor. The vector space of these two legs do not have direct physical meaning, thus we call them virtual legs, and the corresponding vector spaces as virtual spaces. The tensor <span>$B^{[i]]$</span> which does not have a physical leg is called a bond tensor. The existence of bond tensor is convenient when we construct the MPS in the projected entangled-pairs way. The bond tensors represent the maximally entangled pairs in the virtual space and the site tensors are projections from virtual spaces to physical space.</p><h2 id="ss_canonicalform"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#ss_canonicalform">Canonical form</a><a id="ss_canonicalform-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#ss_canonicalform" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>There are different canonical forms of the MPS: left canonical form, right canonical form, site canonical form, bond canonical form, Gamma-Lambda form... They can be transformed to each other.</p><p>In Gamma-Lambda form, the bond tensors <span>$B^{[i]}$</span> are renamed as the Lambda tensors <span>$Λ^{[i]}$</span>, which is a diagonal matrix that stores the Schmidt values of that bond. We draw the MPS in Gamma-Lambda as</p><p><img src="../figures/mps_GammaLambda.svg" alt="mps_GammaLambda"/></p><p>If the above MPS is a finite MPS with length <span>$L=3$</span>, we will have <span>$Λ^{[1]}=Λ^{[4]}=1$</span>, since the first and last bonds are trivial with bond dimension <span>$1$</span>. If we are thinking about an infinite MPS which is a translational invariant structure with unit cell of length <span>$3$</span>, we need to identify <span>$Λ^{[4]}$</span> with <span>$Λ^{[1]}$</span> and they are not trivial.</p><p>Once we obtain the Gamma-Lambda form, the left canonical form can be obtained by defining the local site tensor as <span>$AL^{[i]}= Λ^{[i]}Γ^{[i]}$</span>, and the right canonical form can be obtained by defining the local site tensor as <span>$AR^{[i]}=Γ^{[i]}Λ^{[i+1]}$</span>. The site canonical form with central site <span>$n$</span> can be obtained by defining the the site tensors on <span>$i= 1,...,n-1$</span> as <span>$AL^{[i]}$</span>, the site tensors on <span>$i = n+1,...,L$</span> as <span>$AR^{[i]}$</span>, and the central site tensor as <span>$AC^{[n]}=Λ^{[n]}Γ^{[n]}Λ^{[n+1]}$</span>.</p><p>We will store the Schmidt values of each bond separately no matter which canonical form we are in. And we label the site tensors by left, right, site, and Gamma. If in left, right and site canonical form, the bond tensors are identities. If in Gamma-Lambda form, the bond tensors are Λ matrices whose diagonal elements are the Schmidt values. If in non-canonical form, the bond tensors can be any matrices. It is useful when we construct the MPS from projected entangled pairs.</p><p>Now we discuss how to transform a general MPS to canonical forms.</p><p>For a finite MPS, it can be done by doing SVD or QR decomposition from one end of the MPS.</p><p>For an infinite MPS, it is in principle can be obtained by diagonalizing the transfer matrix. A better way is explained in [ref].</p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><a class="docs-footer-prevpage" href="../../">« Home</a><a class="docs-footer-nextpage" href="../../index/">Index »</a><div class="flexbox-break"></div><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 0.27.6 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Friday 8 October 2021 02:51">Friday 8 October 2021</span>.
