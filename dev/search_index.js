A directed graph is a lattice structure with discrete lattice sites on some spatial points and each site has some directed lines attached to it. Each directed line has an arrow on it. Some of the lines connect two different sites directly, while each of the other lines attach to only one site and has an open end.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"(Image: mps_graph)","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"Tensor network is a network structure of tensor maps on a directed graph. We associate a vector space (or in general, an object of a tensor category) to each directed line and a tensor map to each lattice site. The arrow on each line is used to distinguish the   vector space and its dual, i.e., the dual of a vector space V is represented by a leg of vector space V with an arrow pointing in the opposite direction. A tensor map is a linear map from its domain to codomain. We numerate all the lines attached to a site as 1  N_1+N_2, and treat the tensor product of the spaces on lines 1N_1 as the codomain and that on lines N_1+1N_1+N_2 as the domain. A tensor is a tensor map with a trivial domain (N_2=0), or equivalently, a line corresponding to the unit simple object of the tensor category which can be removed or added at will. If a line connects two sites, it represents a contraction between two tensor maps. We also call the lines as legs or bonds.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"Matrix product state is a tensor network that all the lattice sites are ordered in a one-dimensional chain and each tensor only connects to its left and right nearest neighbors.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"The basic form of an MPS is","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"(Image: mps_convention)","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"We use the conventions that are consistent with that in TensorLabXD.jl as shown in (b) and (c) of the above figure.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"The most general form of an MPS is","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"(Image: mps_ABconvention)","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"Since MPSs are usually used to represent the wave functions of quantum many-body systems on a lattice and each lattice site hosts a Hilbert space, the tensor A^i on that lattice site has an open leg which hosts the physical Hilbert space. We call the tensor map A^i as a site tensor and its open leg as the physical leg. A^i also has two legs that    connect to its left and right neighbors. The vector space of these two legs do not have direct physical meaning, thus we call them virtual legs, and the corresponding vector spaces as virtual spaces. The tensor B^i, which does not have a physical leg, is called a bond tensor. The existence of bond tensor is convenient when we construct the MPS in the projected entangled-pairs way. The bond tensors represent the maximally entangled pairs in the virtual space and the site tensors are projections from virtual spaces to the physical space.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/#ss_fundamentaltheorem","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"fundamental theorem of MPS","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/MPS/#ss_canonicalform","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Canonical form","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"There are different canonical forms of the MPS: left canonical form, right canonical form, site canonical form, bond canonical form, Gamma-Lambda form...

The site canonical form with central site n can be obtained by defining the the site tensors on i= 1n-1 as AL^i, the site tensors on i = n+1L as AR^i, and the central site tensor as AC^n=Λ^nΓ^nΛ^n+1.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"We will store the Schmidt values of each bond separately no matter which canonical form we are in.
