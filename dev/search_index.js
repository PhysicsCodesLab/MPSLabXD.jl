A directed graph is a lattice structure with discrete lattice sites on some spatial points and each site has some directed edges attached to it. Each directed edge has an arrow on it. Some of the edges connect two different sites, while the other edges attach to only one site and have an open end.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"Tensor network is a network structure of tensor maps on a directed graph. We associate a vector space (or in general, an object of a tensor category) to each of the directed edges and a tensor map to each lattice site. The arrow on edges are used to distinguish the vector space and its dual, i.e., the dual of a vector space V is represented by an edge of vector space V with an arrow pointing in the opposite direction. A tensor map is a linear map from its domain to codomain. We numerate all the edges attached to a site as 1  N_1+N_2, and treat the tensor product of the edges 1N_1 as the codomain of the tensor map and treat the tensor product of the edges N_1+1N_1+N_2 as the domain of the tensor map. A tensor is a tensor map which a trivial domain with zero edges or an edge corresponds to unit simple object of the tensor category. If an edge connects two sites, it represents a contraction between two tensor maps. We also call the edges as legs.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"Matrix product state is a tensor network that all the lattice site are ordered as a one-dimensional chain and each tensor only connects to its left and right nearest neighbour.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"The basic structure of an MPS is","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"(Image: mps_convention)","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"We use the conventions that are consistent with that in TensorLabXD.jl.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"There are different canonical forms of the MPS: left canonical form, right canonical form, site canonical form, bond canonical form,                  Gamma-Lambda form...","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"To be able to represent all these different forms under the same structure, we write the MPS as","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"(Image: mps_convention)","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"Since MPSs are usually used to represent the wave functions of quantum many-body systems on a lattice and each lattice site hosts a Hilbert space, the tensor A^i on that site has an open leg which hosts the physical Hilbert space. We call the tensor A^i as a site tensor, and its open leg as the physical leg. A^i also has two legs that connect to its left and right neighbour. The vector space of these two legs do not have direct physical meaning, thus we call them virtual legs or bonds, and the corresponding vector spaces as virtual spaces. The tensor B^i which does not have a physical leg are called a bond tensor. The bond tensors are in principle not necessary, since we can always absorb it into A^i and returns to the original form of MPS with only site tensors. However, we will find later that keeping the bond tensors will make some of the algorithms easier.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Matrix Product State","text":"An MPS can have different boundary conditions","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/MPS/#ss_localtensor","page":"Matrix Product State","title":"Local tensor","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index/#Index","page":"Index","title":"Index","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index/","page":"Index","title":"Index","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/Examples/#s_Examples","page":"Examples","title":"Examples","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"CurrentModule = MPSLabXD","category":"page"},{"location":"#MPSLabXD","page":"Home","title":"MPSLabXD","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"MPSLabXD.jl is a generic package which implements tensor network methods based on matrix product states (MPS) to calculate the properties of quantum many-body systems.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"It depends on the package TensorLabXD.jl which deals with basic operations of tensor maps.
