# MPSLabXD

[MPSLabXD.jl](https://github.com/PhysicsCodesLab/MPSLabXD.jl) is a generic package which
implements tensor network algorithms based on matrix product states (MPS).

It depends on the package [TensorLabXD.jl](https://github.com/PhysicsCodesLab/TensorLabXD.jl)
which deals with basic operations of tensor maps. (TensorLabXD.jl is a modified version of
Jutho Haegeman's package [TensorKit.jl](https://github.com/Jutho/TensorKit.jl).)
